# ATM and Bank Management System

## Introduction
This is a simple ATM and Bank Management System implemented in Python. It provides functionalities for both **customers** and **bank managers** to manage ATM transactions using text files for data storage.

## Features
### **For Customers:**
- Deposit money into their account
- Withdraw money from their account
- Set or update ATM PIN
- Check account balance

### **For Bank Managers:**
- Issue a new ATM card
- Update ATM numbers
- Block an ATM card
- Check the balance of a specific ATM
- Check total bank balance
- Update manager password

## File Structure
```
üìÇ ATM-Bank-System
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ atm.py          # ATM class handling customer actions
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ bank.py         # Bank class managing ATM accounts
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py         # Main script to run the program
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ atm.txt         # Stores ATM details (ATM number, PIN, balance)
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ password.txt    # Stores manager's password
```

## How It Works
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ ATM Class (atm.py)**
This class handles customer-related operations:
- `generate_pin()`: Allows customers to create a 4-digit PIN.
- `withdraw_balance()`: Withdraws money after PIN verification.
- `deposit_balance()`: Deposits money into the account.
- `check_balance()`: Displays the current account balance.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Bank Class (bank.py)**
The bank manages ATM accounts and data:
- `issue_new_atm()`: Issues a new ATM card and stores it in `atm.txt`.
- `block_atm()`: Blocks an ATM by removing it from the file.
- `update_atm_num()`: Updates an ATM number.
- `check_atm_balance()`: Retrieves the balance of a specific ATM.
- `total_balance_in_bank()`: Computes total money in all accounts.
- `change_password()`: Updates the manager‚Äôs password in `password.txt`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Main Script (main.py)**
This script runs the program and provides:
- **Manager Access**: Requires password verification to access bank management options.
- **Customer Access**: Customers enter their ATM number to perform transactions.

## Installation & Usage
